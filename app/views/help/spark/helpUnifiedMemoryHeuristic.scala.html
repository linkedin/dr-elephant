<p> This is a heuristic for peak Unified Memory </p>
<h4>Peak Unified Memory</h4>
<p>If the peak unified memory is much smaller than allocated executor memory then we recommend to decrease spark.memory.fraction, or total executor memory.</p>
<p>spark.memory.fraction: this is the fraction of (executor memory - reserved memory) used for execution and storage. This partitions user memory from execution and storage memory.</p>
