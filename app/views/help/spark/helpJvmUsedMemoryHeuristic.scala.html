<p>This is a heuristic for peak JVM used memory.</p>
<h4>Executor Max Peak JVM Used Memory</h4>
<p>This is to analyse whether the executor memory is set to a good value. To avoid wasted memory, it checks if the peak JVM used memory is reasonably close to the allocated executor memory, (spark.executor.memory) -- if it is much smaller, then executor memory should be reduced.</p>
<p>The thresholds set currently are : <br>
    Low: spark.executor.memory >= 1.5 * (max peakJvmUsedMemory + 300MB)<br>
    Moderate: spark.executor.memory >= 2 * (max peakJvmUsedMemory + 300MB)<br>
    Severe: spark.executor.memory >= 2.5 * (max peakJvmUsedMemory + 300MB)<br>
    Critical: spark.executor.memory >= 3 * (max peakJvmUsedMemory + 300MB)</p>
<h4>Driver Max Peak JVM Used Memory</h4>
<p>Allocated memory for the driver (spark.driver.memory) is examined and it checks if its much more than the peak JVM memory used by the driver</p>
<p>The thresholds set currently are : <br>
    Low: spark.driver.memory >= 1.5 * (max peakJvmUsedMemory + 300MB)<br>
    Moderate: spark.driver.memory >= 2 * (max peakJvmUsedMemory + 300MB)<br>
    Severe: spark.driver.memory >= 2.5 * (max peakJvmUsedMemory + 300MB)<br>
    Critical: spark.driver.memory >= 3 * (max peakJvmUsedMemory + 300MB)</p>
