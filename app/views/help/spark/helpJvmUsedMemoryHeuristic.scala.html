<p>This is a heuristic for peak JVM used memory.</p>
<h4>Executor Max Peak JVM Used Memory</h4>
<p>This is to analyse whether the executor memory is set to a good value. To avoid wasted memory, it checks if the peak JVM used memory is reasonably close to the allocated executor memory, (spark.executor.memory) -- if it is much smaller, then executor memory should be reduced.</p>
<h4>Executor JVM Used Memory Skew</h4>
<p>If there is a big difference between median and maximum values of the peak JVM used memory, then there could be skew in the data being processed.</p>
<h4>Driver Max Peak JVM Used Memory</h4>
<p>Allocated memory for the driver (spark.driver.memory) is examined and it checks if its much more than the peak JVM memory used by the driver</p>
