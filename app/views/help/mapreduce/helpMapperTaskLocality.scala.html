<p>
    This analysis shows the data locality for your apps. <br>
    We check the ratio between your job's node local map tasks AND the total number of map tasks. <br>
    Also check the ratio between your job's rack local map tasks AND the total number of tasks <br>
    The setting in question here is container memory is "yarn.scheduler.capacity.node-locality-delay". This is the Number of missed scheduling opportunities after which the capacity-scheduler attempts to schedule
     rack local containers. <br>
     For Cloud based storage systems: This number should be low (0 or -1) as there is no notion of data locality and there is no point even checking for it<br>
     For on-prem storage/hdfs with cloud or on-prem compute, this number should be equal to the number of nodes in the cluster to guarantee a scheduling attempt to each data local node.
    If this heuristic is above MODERATE, it means you are making good use of hadoop's most important feature of data locality.

<h4>Suggestions</h4>
<p>

   <br>
    The problem indicates your tasks are not running local to the data. This will cause large network data flow and could lead to bottlenecks for very large jobs.
   <br>
    You should try to increase <strong>yarn.scheduler.capacity.node-locality-delay</strong> to atleast the number of nodes on the cluster
   <br>
   See yarn.scheduler.fair.locality.threshold.node and yarn.scheduler.fair.locality.threshold.rack for fair scheduler
    This will make sure that there is at least one scheduling attempt to each data local node
    <br>

    See <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.3/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html">Capacity Scheduler Node Locality Settings</a> for further information.<br>
