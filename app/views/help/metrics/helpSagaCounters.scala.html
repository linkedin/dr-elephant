<p>
    SAGA Counters are a special category of Hadoop counters because they are not present natively in Hadoop.
    The values of these counters are calculated from the SAGA framework.
    These counters allow to track the number of objects processed by each scientific module
    and thus to detect abnormal behavior (inadequate filtering, duplicate data, etc.).
</p>

<h4>Calculation</h4>
<div>
        'In' value of SAGA counters is the sum of 'HDFS-In' and 'Gbin-In' counters name for a given job. </br>
        'Out' value of SAGA counters is the sum of 'HDFS-Out' and 'Gbin-Out' counters name for a given job.
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>
<img style="width: 100%;" src='@routes.Assets.at("images/sagaCounters1.png")'/>
For this job:
<ul>
    <li><font color="#FF0000">in = 59 + 59 + 59 + 59 + 59 = 295</font></li>
    <li><font color="#0080FF">out = 59 + 7 + 150 + 30 + 59 = 305</font></li>
</ul>
